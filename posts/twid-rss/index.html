A colleague was telling me about <a href=https://feedly.com/>Feedly</a> back in
2013 when I was scrambling around in my first job. I had narrower interests that
were sufficiently sated with GameTrailers.com and other video-heavy
publications. Times have changed! My interests are broader. Commutes (often
without Internet access) are the best times to peruse news. I want to give
priority to news targeted at my interests rather than news discovery. And given
the additional web presence you have when you start a blog, I'm keener to see
what others are up to as well =]</p><p>RSS is perfect for all of this. It's a web syndication format that the vast
majority of content publishers and blogs support. They provide a URL that gives
access to a feed of their content in a client of your choice.</p><p>Most clients these days are smart enough to detect the content format. For
example, Feedly doubles as a podcast player. CLI RSS readers like <a href=https://newsboat.org/>Newsboat</a> and
<a href=https://codezen.org/canto-ng/>Canto</a> facilitate opening an article in a browser for content that contains more
than plain text. Most are very flexible, supporting things like keyword filters
and changing the order feeds are displayed.</p><p>The key thing is that you control the content you want to see. I went through
the phase of using social media for updates. The feeds are endless. The content
is tailored to you based on some initial preferences you supply and then the
algorithm takes over. Most articles will at least contain something
interesting. In a few, you may learn something of value. But it's not efficient.</p><p>I moved on Hacker News next, which I know <em>many</em> people find perfectly
sufficient, but it's also an endless feed. I found myself sifting down into the
triple digits on some commutes trying to find something to distract me. It made
me realise that I was spending as much time, if not more, searching for content
rather than learning from it.</p><p>Now I have a just a few feeds set up in Feedly. I can fine tune it to sources
that I find interesting. That's an ongoing process and one that is far from
being optimal, but it means that when I check Feedly there's a much higher
chance I'll learn rather than sift. I've chosen feeds that post a maximum of a
few times per day so that I can look forward to a steady stream of new content
every morning without getting overwhelmed. This may become too frequent as I
discover more feeds, and I'll readjust then if necessary. Having that level of
control is a real asset. Once I've read through everything, I feel confident
that I've &ldquo;caught up&rdquo;. I can then focus on other things, like creating content
myself!</p><p>It's not a perfect setup. There are topics out there that could be my next
passion but are completely off my radar, hidden on the other side of the
Internet. Locating such topics is hard, but prove incredibly fruitful when you
do! For that reason, I still check Hacker News occasionally, but limit myself to
the top stories. There's feeds specifically tailored for top Hacker News stories
that could prove to be a great compromise.</p><p>I'm still on the hunt for feeds. Some that have proved worthwhile subscriptions
in the last week are the <a href=https://blog.trello.com/>Trello blog</a>, various <a href=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/>Gamasutra blogs</a>, <a href=https://opensource.com/>Opensource.com</a>
and, of course, <a href=https://this-week-in-rust.org/>This Week in Rust</a>! Here's to discovering what else is out there.</p></div><hr class=post-end><footer class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://www.kwyse.com/tags/twid>twid</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://www.kwyse.com/tags/blogging>blogging</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>572 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2018-01-07</p></footer></article><div class="post-nav thin"><a class=next-post href=https://www.kwyse.com/posts/hugo-two-weeks-in/><span class=post-nav-label><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5"/></svg>&nbsp;Newer</span><br><span>Hugo, Two Weeks In</span></a>
