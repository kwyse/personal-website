Hello there, friend. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

Interested in Rust?  Or systems programming in general? Perhaps you like game
development? Or perhaps you're not a software engineer but a photographer, or a
traveller? Maybe continuous self-improvement is very important to you and you
prioritise your physical and mental health, relishing in overcoming yesterday's
limitations? Maybe you seek out insight from whoever is willing to give,
chasing an ideal of an ever-maturing and more balanced perspective on our
world—one that brings you greater peace. Maybe, just maybe, you identify with
more aspects than can ever be listed here.

This blog may not represent all of these virtues—not yet, anyway—but they're all
facets of my life that I value and would like to write about more. If my posts
give _you_ some value, dead reader, then it's a win-win. It's my hope that you
find something useful here.
