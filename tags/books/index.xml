But writing it prompted me to consider if the book's bombast was his own or used more for purposes of sensationalism.
I watched part this AMA from him and his comments on escapism got me thinking.

In fact, the first five Harry Potter books are the only fiction books I can recall reading in my life prior to graduating from university.</description></item></channel></rss>
