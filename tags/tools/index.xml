It&amp;rsquo;s associated with the typical Vim power user setup. I remember playing with it back when I first started using Vim as well. The problem I had was why. Vim already has panes, what many other applications would call split windows. And if you use a tiling window manager like i3, you have panes at the application level as well.</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: Vim Minimalism</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vim-minimalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vim-minimalism/</guid><description>Last month marked four years since I started my dotfiles repository on GitHub. Now it&amp;rsquo;s in a state of disrepair! I had no idea that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made a single commit to it throughout 2017. I did though, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t push them. There are local changes on every computer that I work with. Some were the results of experiments I later forgot about and others were quickly-needed hacks that I didn&amp;rsquo;t find time to refactor and stabilise.</description></item></channel></rss>
