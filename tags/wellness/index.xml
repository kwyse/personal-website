Walking was painful for the subsequent few days but it was manageable. The pain was moderate but tolerable. Then this past Tuesday I fainted! And it's related.
The medical professionals tell me that I'm completely healthy, and what happened to me is a case of vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is fainting because of your body overreacting to certain triggers. One of these triggers is pain, and it needn't even be severe pain!</description></item><item><title>Five Month's Into the Hacker's Diet</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/five-months-into-hackers-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/five-months-into-hackers-diet/</guid><description>I've always had weight problems. Only in recent years has it gotten under control and landed me comfortably in the overweight category, like I was last summer. It wasn't life threatening but it wasn't ideal either. For the most part it was stable, and I was stable living with it. Yet it only took one comment from a work colleague, one with harmless intention, to change my mind on that.</description></item></channel></rss>
