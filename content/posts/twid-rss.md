This is actually a rediscovery. A colleague was telling me about
[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) back in 2013 when I was scrambling around in my
first job. I had narrower interests that were sufficiently sated with
GameTrailers.com and other video-heavy publications. Times have changed! My
interests are broader.  Commutes (often without Internet access) are the best
times to peruse news. I want to give priority to news targeted at my interests
rather than news discovery. And given the additional web presence you have when
you start a blog, I'm keener to see what others are up to as well =]

RSS is perfect for all of this. It's a web syndication format that the vast
majority of content publishers and blogs support. They provide a URL that gives
access to a feed of their content in a client of your choice.

Most clients these days are smart enough to detect the content format. For
example, Feedly doubles as a podcast player. CLI RSS readers like
[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) and [Canto](https://codezen.org/canto-ng/)
facilitate opening an article in a browser for content that contains more than
plain text. Most are very flexible, supporting things like keyword filters and
changing the order feeds are displayed.

The key thing is that you control the content you want to see. I went through
the phase of using social media for updates. The feeds are endless. The content
is tailored to you based on some initial preferences you supply and then the
algorithm takes over. Most articles will at least contain something interesting.
In a few, you may learn something of value. But it's not efficient.

I moved on Hacker News next, which I know *many* people find perfectly
sufficient, but it's also an endless feed. I found myself sifting down into the
triple digits on some commutes trying to find something to distract me. It made
me realise that I was spending as much time, if not more, searching for content
rather than learning from it.

Now I have a just a few feeds set up in Feedly. I can fine tune it to sources
that I find interesting. That's an ongoing process and one that is far from
being optimal, but it means that when I check Feedly there's a much higher
chance I'll learn rather than sift. I've purposely chosen feeds that post a few
times a day as their frequency limit, so that I can look forward to a steady
stream of new content every morning but not get overwhelmed. This may become too
frequent as I discover more feeds, and I'll readjust then if necessary. Having
that level of control is a real asset. Once I've read through everything, I feel
confident that I've "caught up". I can then focus on other things, like creating
content myself!

It's not a perfect setup. There are topics out there that could be my next
passion but are completely off my radar, hidden on the other side of the
Internet. Locating such topics is hard, but prove incredibly fruitful when you
do! For that reason, I still check Hacker News occasionally, but limit myself to
the top stories.  There's feeds specifically tailored for top Hacker News
stories which I plan to look into.

I'm still on the hunt for feeds. Some that have proved worthwhile subscriptions
in the last week are the [Trello blog](https://blog.trello.com/), various
[Gamasutra blogs](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/),
[Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) and, of course, [This Week in
Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)! I look forward to discovering what else
is out there!
