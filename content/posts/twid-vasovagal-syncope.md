I sprained my ankle during the week before last. Walking was painful for the
subsequent few days but it was manageable. The pain was moderate but
tolerable. Then this past Tuesday I fainted! And it's related.

The medical professionals tell me that I'm completely healthy, and what happened
to me is a case of _vasovagal syncope_.  [Vasovagal syncope](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527) is fainting because
of your body overreacting to certain triggers. One of these triggers is pain,
and it needn't even be severe pain!

In my case, it happened about 20 minutes after I woke up. The first time I put
weight on my ankle every morning still hurts, but on that morning it caused me
to feel nauseas, faint---luckily only into a table, and the only damage is a
little scratch on my neck---and come-to in a cold sweat.

The cause is a lowered heart rate and blood pressure that lasts only a few
seconds, but this is enough to stop feeding oxygen to your brain and cause you
to black-out. You can prevent it by lying down immediately, so that blood can
reach your brain more easily.

This is the first time I've fainted and, whilst a little scary, was educational
more than anything else. It's fascinating to know how your body responds to
certain predicaments, and how you can respond to those responses when they're
not ideal.
