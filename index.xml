A recent foray into app develop prompted me to check out React Native. Right from the start, the documentation recommends creating a project from a generator â€” and the project it creates is big. It then doesn&amp;rsquo;t go on to explain what each of the individual files are doing.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of this approach.</description></item><item><title>Deploying an ox-hugo blog with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/deploying-ox-hugo-blog-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/deploying-ox-hugo-blog-with-github-actions/</guid><description>The blogging flow provided by ox-hugo suggests that Markdown files should be committed to the source repository along with the Org file. I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to do that because the Markdown files are effectively a build artefact in this flow. I also couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information on how to integrate ox-hugo&amp;rsquo;s export functionality with a continuous integration service.
Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s quite simple to do with GitHub Actions. After following the instructions for the hugo-setup Action (these at the time of writing), we must then export the Org file as part of the workflow.</description></item><item><title>Taking Escapism for Granted</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/taking-escapism-for-granted/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/taking-escapism-for-granted/</guid><description>My last post levelled more criticism than merit to Rollo Tomassi&amp;rsquo;s book The Rational Male. But writing it prompted me to consider if the book&amp;rsquo;s bombast was his own or used more for purposes of sensationalism.
I watched part this AMA from him and his comments on escapism got me thinking. In my world&amp;mdash;my work and social circles&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s considered a perfectly valid activity to engage in and often. But why is this the case?</description></item><item><title>Books of 2019</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/books-of-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/books-of-2019/</guid><description>I was a gamer. Words on a page did not enrapture me to the degree that interactive media did. Symbiosis between the visual, aural, narrative, and interactive was beauty itself.
That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t read. Games have their fair share of text, but I had trouble maintaining focus when reading physical books. In fact, the first five Harry Potter books are the only fiction books I can recall reading in my life prior to graduating from university.</description></item><item><title>On Fundamentals</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/on-fundamentals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/on-fundamentals/</guid><description>A recent vacation gave me time to catch up on my backlog of books. Stop Guessing, by Nat Greene, was my first target. It&amp;rsquo;s a book about the tendency to guess solutions when faced with hard problems, and instead proposes a rigorous, fact-backed and systematic approach to problem solving. There is a chapter dedicated to understanding the fundamentals of the problem space that was particularly poignant to me.
If we define a hard problem as simply something that is resistant to guesses, impactful and yet hard to isolate and reproduce, then they&amp;rsquo;re not uncommon in the life of a software developer.</description></item><item><title>Book Recommendation: Programming Rust</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/book-recommendation-programming-rust/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/book-recommendation-programming-rust/</guid><description>Most of us can agree that Rust&amp;rsquo;s learning curve is steep. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for hobby projects for the last few years but I&amp;rsquo;m still hesitant to use it when I&amp;rsquo;m constrained by a deadline, because of the upfront cost in development time. And that&amp;rsquo;s frustrating, because I really believe that the benefits it offers outweigh that.
Programming Rust is included in the latest Humble Functional Programming book bundle. Take a look on Amazon and you&amp;rsquo;ll see it&amp;rsquo;s getting some pretty rave reviews.</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: Vasovagal Syncope</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vasovagal-syncope/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vasovagal-syncope/</guid><description>I sprained my ankle during the week before last. Walking was painful for the subsequent few days but it was manageable. The pain was moderate but tolerable. Then this past Tuesday I fainted! And it&amp;rsquo;s related.
The medical professionals tell me that I&amp;rsquo;m completely healthy, and what happened to me is a case of vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is fainting because of your body overreacting to certain triggers. One of these triggers is pain, and it needn&amp;rsquo;t even be severe pain!</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: CliftonStrengths</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-clifton-strenths/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-clifton-strenths/</guid><description>I came across this talk by Scott Dinsmore. It&amp;rsquo;s geared towards those who feel trapped trapped in their current circumstances, yet my main take-away was his recommendation on StrengthsFinder 2.0, now called CliftonStrengths. I took the plunge and bought it since this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time it&amp;rsquo;s been recommended.
The book itself is only half of what you&amp;rsquo;re getting as the back sleeve includes a code you can use to take the online assessment.</description></item><item><title>Five Month's Into the Hacker's Diet</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/five-months-into-hackers-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/five-months-into-hackers-diet/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had weight problems. Only in recent years has it gotten under control and landed me comfortably in the overweight category, like I was last summer. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t life threatening but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal either. For the most part it was stable, and I was stable living with it. Yet it only took one comment from a work colleague, one with harmless intention, to change my mind on that.</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: Tmux</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-tmux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-tmux/</guid><description>Tmux seems like a natural progression from last week&amp;rsquo;s Vim Minimalism, right? It&amp;rsquo;s associated with the typical Vim power user setup. I remember playing with it back when I first started using Vim as well. The problem I had was why. Vim already has panes, what many other applications would call split windows. And if you use a tiling window manager like i3, you have panes at the application level as well.</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: Vim Minimalism</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vim-minimalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-vim-minimalism/</guid><description>Last month marked four years since I started my dotfiles repository on GitHub. Now it&amp;rsquo;s in a state of disrepair! I had no idea that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made a single commit to it throughout 2017. I did though, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t push them. There are local changes on every computer that I work with. Some were the results of experiments I later forgot about and others were quickly-needed hacks that I didn&amp;rsquo;t find time to refactor and stabilise.</description></item><item><title>Hugo, Two Weeks In</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/hugo-two-weeks-in/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/hugo-two-weeks-in/</guid><description>My last post about Hugo focused on getting it set up. It finished with a few ideas on improvements. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a few implemented since then =]
One-liner improvements Some of these were very simple to add. The theme I&amp;rsquo;m using, Minimo, supports adding a reading time to posts with one addition to config.toml.
showReadingTime = true It&amp;rsquo;s a small addition yet adds noted value for the reader.
The next change instead provides insight for the sight maintainer:</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: RSS</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-rss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-rss/</guid><description>This is actually a rediscovery. A colleague was telling me about Feedly back in 2013 when I was scrambling around in my first job. I had narrower interests that were sufficiently sated with GameTrailers.com and other video-heavy publications. Times have changed! My interests are broader. Commutes (often without Internet access) are the best times to peruse news. I want to give priority to news targeted at my interests rather than news discovery.</description></item><item><title>Grokking Entity-Component-Systems</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/grokking-entity-component-systems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/grokking-entity-component-systems/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many commutes in the last few months learning the intricacies of Specs, an entity-component-system (ECS) written in Rust and, to be more broad, ECSs in general. ECSs have proved to be a much deeper topic than I had initially anticipated. Now I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain my findings in order to solidify that knowledge.
ECSs are a decoupling pattern. They&amp;rsquo;re most frequently seen in game development where we often have many similar yet distinct types of game objects.</description></item><item><title>This Week I Discovered: OpenMW</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-open-mw/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/twid-open-mw/</guid><description>Two weeks back I installed Gentoo with the intention to use it as my primary desktop. Naturally I need games to play. My go-to benchmark for the state of Linux gaming has always been the Wine Application Database, so I checked it for a game I knew I could sink countless hours into.
Well it turns out the results for Oblivion are not too promising, especially for Steam. Maybe Morrowind fairs better?</description></item><item><title>Hail, Hugo!</title><link>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/hail-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kwyse.com/posts/hail-hugo/</guid><description>One of my goals this holiday season was to relaunch my blog. My previous attempt failed because there was too much friction in actually blogging. It was an Iron-backed Rust web app using PostgreSQL and Diesel on a DigitalOcean host behind NGINX. It was my first time using most of these technologies for anything serious. I learnt a lot about them in the course of building that blog but the fifth blog post never saw the light of day.</description></item></channel></rss>
